// Create an array of words to choose from

// Take a random selection from the array

// Display word as underscrores for number of letters in the word

// Create number of guesses allowed (10)

// Add onkey input for all letters of the alphabet (toLowerCase)

// If input matches a letter in the word, fill in that letter (includes)

// If input does not match, add the letter to the already guessed section & subtract one guess

// If the same letter is guessed again, do nothing

// Only allow letters as entries

// If they guess 10 letters with no success, they lose the game (alert)

// If they successfully fill in the word with the correct letters, they win the game (alert)

// Either way, they get a new word to guess

// Continue until all words have been guessed, then game stops
